PoMaTo --- Power Market Tool, Engineered for Power Market Analysis
==================================================================


The idea of Pomato is to provide an easy to use tool that inhibits all the power system engineering that is necessary for comprehensive analyses of the modern power market. It is more flexible and powerful than studies in Excel but sets aside the unnecessary detail of engineering software like Integral or PowerFactory. 

Pomato currently includes:

* Data
    * Supports Excel Data
    * Support MatPowerCase Data

* Grid
    * Fast network representation with recalculated network constraints
    * Including n-1 security constrained dispatch

* Various options for market representation
    * Nodal or Zonal optimization
    * Including Electricity-Heat Coupling

* GUI 
    * Powerful Interactive Plotting
    * Possible Map-Layouts
    * Soon to come: GUI based input data handling
